## Overview

This repository contains the modelling work, data sources, and literature framework for a **System Dynamics (SD) simulation of the Bavarian wood supply chain**, with a focus on sawmill dynamics.

The thesis is structured as a two-part collaborative project:

| Role | Contributor | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| Literature review + model framework | Jon Gurakuqi | MFA, SD variable map, theoretical framework, scenario design |
| AnyLogic implementation | Abdul | Working SD simulation model in AnyLogic |

The simulation will be built in **AnyLogic** using stocks, flows, and feedback loops derived from the literature review and Material Flow Analysis (MFA) conducted in this thesis.


## Abstract

This thesis develops a System Dynamics (SD) simulation framework for the Bavarian
wood supply chain, with the sawmill as the central node of analysis. The supply chain
is modelled across four stages — Regional Forest → Regional Sawmills → Wood Products
→ Zimmerer / House Builders — with additional flows capturing imports from outside the
region, sawmill exports to other regional customers, and by-products including bark,
sawdust, and rest wood.

The work is structured as a two-part collaborative project. This thesis contributes the
literature review, Material Flow Analysis (MFA), and theoretical model framework,
identifying the relevant stocks, flows, and feedback loops grounded in real Bavarian
data. A parallel thesis (Abdul Rehman Mushtaq) implements the model in AnyLogic.

The MFA is calibrated against publicly available official statistics, including the fourth
Bundeswaldinventur (BWI4, October 2024), the LWF/CARMEN Energieholzmarkt Bayern
2022 report, and annual harvest data from the Bayerische Landesanstalt für Wald und
Forstwirtschaft (LWF). Three MFA models are developed: a baseline linear flow model,
a stock-based model with quantified Bavarian volumes and mapped data sources, and a
disruption scenario model applying a force majeure factor (ff) to simulate sawmill
capacity constraints under different shock conditions.

Three disruption scenarios are defined and parameterised: a bark beetle-driven supply
shock, a COVID-19 construction demand collapse, and an energy price shock. Each
scenario draws on the force majeure formulation from Sinha et al. (2020) and the super
disruption classification framework from Franco (2021). The theoretical foundation
combines Sterman's System Dynamics methodology (2000), Buffer Stock Theory (Arrow,
Harris & Marschak, 1951), the LARG supply chain framework (Cabral et al., 2012 via
Sinha et al., 2020), and Ivanov's supply chain resilience classification (2021 via Franco,
2021).

The central research question is: Can the regional Bavarian wood supply chain still
supply enough timber to Zimmerer / house builders when demand increases, forest
supply changes, or imports become difficult?





---

## Thesis Focus

**Central question:** How do disruptions propagate through the Bavarian wood supply chain — specifically at the sawmill stage — and how can a System Dynamics model simulate inventory accumulation, demand response, and recovery dynamics?


**Geographic scope:** Bavaria (Freistaat Bayern), Germany
**Supply chain focus:** Forest → Sawmill → Processed timber → Market
**Primary node:** Sawmills — capacity constraints, input disruption, output volatility

## What this thesis does

Develops a conceptual System Dynamics model for the wood supply chain in Sudostoberbayern. Maps the flow of wood from forest to sawmill to Zimmerer (timber construction firms) and tests how external disruptions affect price stability.

Jon builds the conceptual model (CLDs, stocks, flows, feedback loops). Abdul implements it in AnyLogic.

## Region

Sudostoberbayern (SOB): Landkreise Traunstein, Berchtesgadener Land, Rosenheim (Stadt + Land), Muhldorf am Inn, Altotting. ~178,700 ha forest | ~5,400 km2 | ~830,000 inhabitants.

## The MFA - A | The improved version with the Austria loop

      |                      |---> By-products 41% (bark, sawdust)
      |
      |---> Energy wood 37% (pellets, firewood)
      |---> Roundwood export to AT 2.0M Fm

                  |
                  '---> Sawn timber re-import to Zimmerer
```

**Key structural issue:** SOB exports roundwood to Austrian mills, then re-imports sawn timber from those same mills.



Without Data | The base structure. Three stages, the core external flows, no quantities yet. This is the skeleton the analysis starts from.

```
                    Outside Region (AT, CZ)
                           |
                      Imported wood
                           |
                           v
Regional Forest ----> Regional Sawmills ----> Zimmerer / Builders
      |                      |
      |                      |---> Exports
      |                      |---> By-products (bark, sawdust, chips)
      |
      |---> Energy wood (pellets, firewood)
```

With Data | The base structure with real Südostoberbayern data filled into each stage and flow. Same skeleton as MFA-B, now grounded in numbers.

## Material Flow Analysis (MFA)

The MFA maps the physical flow of wood through the Bavarian supply chain and provides the empirical backbone for all SD model variables.

### Four-stage flow structure

```
[FOREST STOCK]
      |
      | Harvest Rate (Efm/year)
      ↓
[SAWMILL INPUT]
      |
      | Processing Rate (m³ sawn / year)
      ↓
[SAWN TIMBER INVENTORY]
      |
      | Demand Rate / Market Flow
      ↓
[MARKET OUTPUT]
    /   \
Domestic  Export
```

### Key data points (Bavaria)

| Variable | Value | Year | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total timber harvest | 20.7 million Efm | 2024 | LWF Bayern |
| 10-year average harvest | 18.6 million Efm | 2014-2023 | LWF Bayern |
| Damage wood share | 52% of total harvest | 2024 | LWF Bayern |
| Bayern share of German harvest | ~33% | 2023 | Destatis |
| Softwood (spruce/pine) share | ~72% | 2023 | LWF Bayern |

## SD Model Framework

The simulation model is built on three core SD concepts, grounded in the three key papers.

### Stocks (Level Variables)

| Stock | Description | Unit | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Forest Timber Stock | Standing timber volume available for harvest | Million m³ | LWF / BWI |
| Sawmill Input Inventory | Raw timber held at or en route to sawmills | Thousand Efm | LWF / BaySF |
| Sawn Timber Inventory (It) | Finished sawn timber awaiting sale | Thousand m³ | Cluster Studie |
| Backlog (Bt) | Unfulfilled market orders | Thousand m³ | Sinha et al. (2020) |

### Flows (Rate Variables)

| Flow | Description | Unit | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Harvest Rate | Timber extracted from forest per period | Efm / year | LWF |
| Processing Rate (∂Qt) | Sawmill throughput — raw input to sawn output | m³ / year | Cluster Studie |
| Demand Rate | Market orders placed per period | m³ / year | BMEL / Eurostat |
| Supply Rate (∂St) | Sawn timber shipped to market | m³ / year | Sinha et al. (2020) |
| Forest Growth Rate | Annual increment of forest stock | m³ / year | BWI4 / LWF |

### Feedback Loops

| Loop | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Harvest → Inventory → Price → Harvest | Balancing (−) | High inventory signals lower prices, reduces harvest incentive |
| Damage event → Forced harvest → Inventory glut | Reinforcing (+) | Bark beetle / storm damage forces excess harvest, collapses price |
| Backlog → Production ramp-up → Lead time | Balancing (−) | Unfulfilled orders drive sawmill capacity increase, subject to delay |
| Sawmill capacity constraint | Balancing (−) | Maximum throughput limits production rate regardless of inventory |

### Force Majeure Factor (ff)

Following Sinha et al. (2020): ff takes a value between 0 (complete stoppage) and 1 (normal activity). Applied to model external disruption scenarios at the sawmill stage.

## Test Scenarios

To be confirmed with Prof. Dr. Ott after MFA review.

| Scenario | Shock Type | ff Value | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | No disruption | 1.0 | Full run |
| Energy price shock | Cost increase — logistics disruption | 0.7 - 0.9 | 12-24 months |
| Sawmill capacity reduction | Processing constraint | 0.5 | 12 months |

## Theoretical Framework

Two theories ground the model design:

1. **Buffer Stock Theory** — Arrow, Harris & Marschak (1951): firms hold excess inventory as a hedge against supply and demand uncertainty. Applied to sawmill inventory accumulation under disruption.

2. **System Dynamics Methodology** — Sterman (2000): stocks, flows, and feedback loops model complex system behaviour over time.

## Notes

- Simulation development is **Abdul's deliverable** — Jon defines the model framework, Abdul implements in AnyLogic
- MFA must be reviewed and approved by Prof. Dr. Ott **before** scenario testing begins
- All data is sourced from publicly available official statistics — no proprietary data required
- Model complexity principle: *"As simple as possible — but as complex as needed"* (Sterman, 2000 via Dellas et al., 2022)
